AI Usage Documentation

This project used AI tools (primarily ChatGPT) to support planning, coding, and clarification of technical steps. The following summarizes how AI contributed and how all AI-assisted work was verified.

Purpose of AI Use

AI was used for:

refining the project idea and proposal

drafting template repository files (README, directory structure, placeholder scripts)

generating initial code blocks for Google Colab (e.g., repository cloning, installing NanoSim, running Minimap2)

troubleshooting errors and interpreting log outputs

drafting portions of the draft report

AI was not used to generate biological data, run aligners, or create results.

Verification of AI Outputs

All AI-generated text and code were manually reviewed and tested:

Code was executed in Colab and corrected where necessary.

Method descriptions were cross-checked with official documentation.

File structure was compared against course reproducibility requirements.

Draft report text was edited for accuracy and rewritten in my own words.

Ethical Considerations

No private or confidential data were provided to AI tools.

AI was not used to fabricate data or produce results.

Final responsibility for correctness and interpretation remains with me.

Attribution

AI assistance (ChatGPT) will be cited in the final report and documented in this file as required by course policy.
